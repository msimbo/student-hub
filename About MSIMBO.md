## Assignments & Exercises
You must type each in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the program.

We will focus on materials that will help you solve practical problems as you will in the real world.

## Team Project
The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with developing a full web application fro ground up.

Students will be conducted in group of 3 - 4 to collaborate on a projects due at the end of the course. This projects will allow students to collaboratively complete a web application from start to finish, including design & creation, optimization.

You will have an opportunity to rework an assignment up to 3 times after which it will receive a "pass." A pass means you are having an issue with this concept and will hold off on it and come back to it later.

You will be required to finish all you passes before graduating. You cannot have more than 2 pending passes.

## Submission

- A project is complete when deployed live (usually to Vercel). You must submit your live Vercel and GitHub link

Your code is expected to be idiomatic and properly documented.

## Virtual Class Environment
Our classes will be conducted on Teams.

To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes teaching and learning, all participants share a responsibility in creating a civil and non-disruptive forum for the discussion of idea. As a student, you are expected to conduct yourself at all times in a manner that does not disrupt teaching or learning. Your comments to others should be constructive and free from harassing statements. You are encouraged to disagree with other students and the instructor, but such disagreements need to respectful and be based upon facts and documentation (rather than prejudices and personalities).

Part of the learning process in this course is respectful engagement of ideas with others.

## Attendance
